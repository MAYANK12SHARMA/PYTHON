In Python, a list is a built-in data type used to store a collection of items. Lists are ordered, mutable (modifiable), and can contain elements of different data types.

You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within square brackets []. Elements can be of any data type.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana", True]
