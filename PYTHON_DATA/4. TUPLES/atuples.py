# # ? In Python, a tuple is a collection data type that is similar to a list. However, there are key differences between tuples and lists:

# ? Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed or modified after the tuple is created. Once a tuple is defined, you cannot add, remove, or modify elements.

# ! Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
